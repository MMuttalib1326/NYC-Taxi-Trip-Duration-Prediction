# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Duration-Prediction
Task is to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and many other variables

<h2> :book: Introduction:</h2>

* Limousine Commission is a well-known Taxi service provider that is used by millions of people in New York.



* This EDA will use Python libraries, matplotlib, and Seaborn to examine the Netflix dataset through visualizations and graphs. 



* The dataset is based on the 2016 NYC Cab trip record data, The data was originally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission.



* Machine learning has a wide range of applications in our organization. Personalization has long been the most well-known application of machine learning.



* Our major goal in this project is to identify key patterns,hidden insights and build a model that predicts the Total Ride Duration of Taxi Trips in New York City.

<h2> :book: Abstract:</h2>

* The Taxi service company provides booking services and every day thousands of bookings happen and many customers use its service. .

* Exploratory Data Analysis is done on the dataset to get the insights from the information however the principal invalid qualities are taken care of. Likewise, Likewise, some hypothesis testing was additionally performed from the experiences from EDA.

* After that using the Data visualisation analyzed the relationship between different variables with respect to Target variable to obtain and understand various factors.

* Performed the data analysis and prediction with machine learning algorithms taking into account previous trends to determine the insights about the trip duration.

<h2> :book: Dataset information:</h2>


* **Id**- A unique id for each trip


* **Vendor_id** - A code specifying the provider associated with the trip record.



* **Pickup_datetime** - Pick up date and time or Time of meter started.


* **Dropoff_datetime** - Dropped off date and time or Time of meter started.


* **Passenger_count** - Passenger count as entered by the driver.


* **Pickup_longitude** - Longitude details of Pick up or when the meter started.


* **Pickup_latitude** - latitude details of Pick up or when the meter started.


* **Dropoff_longitude** - Longitude details of a dropoff or when the meter turned off


* **Store_and_fwd_flag** - This flag shows us, whether the trip record was held in-vehicle memory


* **Trip_duration** - It's our target variable and it is the duration of the trip in seconds.

<h2> :book: Problem Statement:</h2>

* This dataset consists of Cab Trip Record data, and the dataset is based on the 2016 NYC Cab trip record data, . 

* The dataset was originally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission..

* The dataset consists the information of Cab Trip Data like pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers etc.

* Based on individual trip attributes, we will be predicting the duration of trip and The task was to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. 

* It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

<h2> :book: Conclusion:</h2>

* Our main goal in this project was to determine different factors affecting to Taxi trip duration and service.

* Before visulization of the data, data analysis was done and checked for the missing values and treated.

* From data visualization, found that Most of the trips durations took between 10-30 mins to complete.

* To predict the trip duration for a particular taxi, we can conclude that XGBooster Regressor is the most suitable model as compared to the other models.

* This type of prediction and research in the cab booking segment helps companies to gain more profit. Predicting bookings and peak hours are a very important factor for cab providers.
